# Visualization

Here we (well... it's just me 😉) provide some functionality to visualize data, interim
results, and more things that I cannot think of just yet, but if you want to display
anything in a nice visual way, you came to the right place!

## plot.py 📈

This file implements the function `plot_trajectory` to visualize the forward pass of the
noising process of data to get an exploratory feel about what we attempt to reverse here.

The scope of the function is solely to visualize a already given trajectory, so an array
of noised 2D-datapoints.
