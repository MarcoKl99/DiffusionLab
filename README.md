# WobblyDiffusion 🧠

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This project aims to explore the techniques for diffusion models together with mathematical
ideas behind it.

The implemented package `diffusion_playground` provides functionality to create simple
diffusion techniques like the forward process (incl. visualization) and training
simple models for the backward process and generating new data.

besides the implementation, the mathematical foundation is a focus of this work, aiming
to understand and apply the theoretical groundwork. For this, `README.md` files can
be found in the packages, outlining usage as well as background of the
modules.
